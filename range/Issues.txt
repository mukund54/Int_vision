1. Solve issue of code showing attentive faces as bored.
	Possible fix:
	Use mean values of emotions to measure level of bored.

	Possible problem:
	Using more images for analysis should mean more accuracy but since we're using max and min values, 
	more images only increase the range, thus resulting in worse accuracy.
